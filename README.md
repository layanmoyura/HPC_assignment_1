# HPC_assignment_1
Problem: Write an MPI program to calculate the average grades for each subject of 50 students. Use a sequential program and an MPI program with 4 processes for faster calculation. Increase the number of students to 10,000 or 100,000 to observe performance improvement. Chart the speed-up by varying the number of students.

## Python

Create a virtual environment

```bash
python3 -m venv mpi_env
source mpi_env/bin/activate
pip install mpi4py
```

## Run All programs and get speed-up values

```bash
./bash.sh
```

##For results and details please refer EG_2018_3397.pdf file
